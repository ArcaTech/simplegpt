It's just a simple ChatGPT frontend. Does text conversation and image generation.


## .env File

Create an .env file in the root of the project with the following variables:

- OPENAI_KEY
- SERVER_PORT (default 3000)


## Building the frontend

Run `npm run build` whenever you make changes to anything on the frontend (in src/app).


## Web Server

Run `npm install` to pull the dependencies, then `npm run serve` to start/restart the web server (which is in /src/server).


## Usage

Once the server is running, go to https://localhost:3000 (or whatever port you used) to view the page.
